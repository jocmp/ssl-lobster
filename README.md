A demo site using the [Rack lobster](https://www.rubydoc.info/gems/rack/Rack/Lobster) application to demo local SSL certs in Rack.

```

## Getting Started

Install [Homebrew](https://docs.brew.sh/) on your system before continuing.

1. Add an entry to your `/etc/hosts` file for `example.test`. Only do this once!
   ```
   make echo-host
   ```

2. Install app dependencies from Homebrew, for Ruby and Bundler.
    ```
    make install
    ```

3. Setup the app. This will install a certificate for example.test using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) and create the certificate and key files in the current directory, ignored by Git.
    ```
    make setup
    ```

4. Run it!
    ```
    make run
    ```
    You should see a familiar nautical crustacean in your web browser at <https://example.com:3001>. Note the use of HTTPS instead of an unsecured connection.
